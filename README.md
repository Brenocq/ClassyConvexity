# Introduction
In this project we aim to classify airplanes using convex hull and machine learning techniques. The first step was to generate our dataset. After that, we calculated the area of each airplane and compared with the convex hull area. At the end, we trained a Support Vector Machine with the area data to classify the aircrafts.
